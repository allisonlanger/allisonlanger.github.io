## Human-Computer Interaction

In collaboration with the The [Development and Experience Center](https://www.dax.fandm.edu/) at Franklin & Marshall College, we're investigating how children learn from social robots. Check out an article about our collaboration [here](https://www.fandm.edu/stories/child-robot-research-merges-psychology-and-computer-science.html)! We have ongoing work examining how children perceive texts and images generated by artificial intelligence that will be presented at the [2025 Digital Media and Developing Minds International Scientific Congress](https://www.childrenandscreens.org/event/2025-digital-media-and-developing-minds-international-scientific-congress/). Stay tuned for results!

## Quantitative Methods

Using data from the [Baby's First Years Project](https://www.babysfirstyears.com/), I used different quantitative methods to investigate stress among mothers enrolled in the study. I presented a [hierarchical linear model](files/LangerSSHDPoster.pdf) at the Society for the Study of Human Development conference in 2023, and a subsequent [structural equation model](https://rpubs.com/allisonlanger/1178499) on RPubs in 2024.

## Stakeholder Reserach

Developers have proposed incorporating social technologies into classrooms to provide adaptive learning tools for students. We worked with teachers in the School District of Philadelphia to understand their thoughts, fears, and impressions of using such tools in their classrooms. I presented on the results from this study at the American Education Research Association Annual Meeting in 2024. See the slides [here](files/Langer_AERA_2024.pdf).

## Technology as a Scalable Diagnositc Tool

This work examines how technology, such as motion tracking tools, can be used to aid in diagnosis and support for autistic individuals. Specifically, I've worked to design a [dance video game](files/Langer_CAR.pdf) to engage adolescents in practicing motor skills at the [Center for Autism Research](https://www.research.chop.edu/car) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), served as an avatar for the Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) (study [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/evaluating-computerised-assessment-of-motor-imitation-cami-for-identifying-autismspecific-difficulties-not-observed-for-attentiondeficit-hyperactivity-disorder-or-neurotypical-development/C477940DE501A840F1D85F6CCF7B7D84), and news article [here](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-01-minute-video-game-success-autism.html)) at the [Kennedy Krieger Institute](https://www.kennedykrieger.org/patient-care/centers-and-programs/center-for-autism-services-science-and-innovation), and contributed to [work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44180-9) investigating how we can quantify social behaviors during child-clinician interactions with motion capture.
