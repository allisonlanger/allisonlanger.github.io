I’m a PhD student in Developmental Psychology at Temple University with specializations in developmental psychopathology and quantitative research methods.\n\nMy research lies at the intersection of psychology and technology.\nSpecifically, I study human-computer interaction, with an emphasis on children’s perception of generative artificial intelligence (AI), the long-term effects and individual predictors of smartphone and social media use across development, and the use of motion capture technology as a scalable diagnostic tool.\nMy work is funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. For info about applying to this fellowship, see resources."

Check out an article about our collaboration here! We have ongoing work examining how children perceive texts and images generated by artificial intelligence that will be presented at the 2025 Digital Media and Developing Minds International Scientific Congress. Stay tuned for results!"

We worked with teachers in the School District of Philadelphia to understand their thoughts, fears, and impressions of using such tools in their classrooms. I presented on the results from this study at the American Education Research Association Annual Meeting in 2024. See the slides here."

Specifically, I’ve worked to design a dance video game to engage adolescents in practicing motor skills at the Center for Autism Research at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), served as an avatar for the Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) (study here, and news article here) at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, and contributed to work investigating how we can quantify social behaviors during child-clinician interactions with motion capture."
