::: {#hero-heading}
Hi, I'm Allison! I'm a PhD student in Developmental Psychology at Temple University with specializations in developmental psychopathology and quantitative research methods.

### My research lies at the intersection of psychology and technology.

Specifically, I study **human-computer interaction**, with an emphasis on children's **perception** of generative artificial intelligence (AI), the **long-term effects** and **individual predictors** of smartphone and social media use across development, and the use of motion capture technology as a **scalable diagnostic tool.**

My work is funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. For info about applying to this fellowship, see [resources](resources.qmd).
